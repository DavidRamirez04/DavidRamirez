    <h1>The Mexican Revolution</h1>
    <h3>Here's a brief explenation about the Mexican revolution</h3>
    <p>The Mexican Revolution was a major revolution that included a sequence of armed struggles that transformed Mexican culture and government. Although the regime of President Porfirio DÃ­az was increasingly unpopular after 31 years, there was no foreboding that a revolution was about to break out in 1910 and ended in 1920.</p>
